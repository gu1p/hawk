# Configuration

Hawk reads `hawk.toml` from the workspace root by default. When that file is
absent, every binary target in the workspace becomes a production target. A
workspace without binaries must configure its audited library targets explicitly.
Use `--config PATH` to select a different configuration file.

## Production targets

Declare every shipped binary or audited internal library with a `[[production]]`
entry:

```toml
[[production]]
package = "uv"
bin = "uv"
reason = "shipped package manager binary"

[[production]]
package = "uv-dev"
bin = "uv-dev"
reason = "developer binary shipped from this workspace"

[[production]]
package = "windows-helper"
bin = "windows-helper"
target = "cfg(windows)"
reason = "Windows-only binary shipped from this workspace"

[[production]]
package = "internal-api"
lib = "internal_api"
reason = "internal library consumed only within this workspace"
```

Each entry must specify exactly one of `bin` or `lib`. Binary targets establish
production reachability from their entry points. Library targets remain
diagnostic candidates: a public item with no workspace uses is reported as
`hawk::dead_public`, an item used only within its own crate is reported as
`hawk::unnecessary_public`, and an item used across a workspace crate boundary
retains `pub`. When every configured production target is a library, diagnostics
are limited to those selected library crates; other workspace crates are
compiled as consumers without becoming audit targets.

Ordinary library targets can use explicit Rust library crate types, including
`crate-type = ["rlib"]`.

Every package and target must belong to the selected Cargo workspace. At least
one production target must apply to the analyzed target and to each configured
feature profile.

By default, every production target is compiled under every feature profile.
Use `feature-profiles` to limit a product to the profiles in which Cargo can
build it. This is useful for a binary with `required-features` while a library
from the same package remains a production target in every profile:

```toml
[[feature-profile]]
name = "all"
all-features = true

[[feature-profile]]
name = "minimal"
no-default-features = true

[[production]]
package = "app"
lib = "app"
feature-profiles = ["all", "minimal"]
reason = "native library shipped in every feature profile"

[[production]]
package = "app"
bin = "video-debug"
feature-profiles = ["all"]
reason = "debug binary requires its opt-in feature"
```

The list must be nonempty, contain no duplicate names, and reference only
configured `[[feature-profile]]` names. Omitting `feature-profiles` means all
profiles, including Hawk's implicit `all-features` profile when no matrix is
configured. Feature-profile selection is independent of the compilation
target. When `hawk.toml` exists, its configured targets remain authoritative;
Hawk does not add other workspace binaries implicitly.

## Doctest packages

By default, Hawk compiles doctests for the entire workspace. Large workspaces
can restrict that pass to packages that contain doctests:

```toml
[[doctest]]
package = "uv-redacted"
```

When any `[[doctest]]` entries are present, Hawk passes only those packages to
`cargo test --doc`. Every configured package must belong to the selected Cargo
workspace. Omit the entries to retain the default full-workspace coverage.

## Feature profiles

By default, Hawk performs one analysis with Cargo's `--all-features` option.
Configure a feature matrix when code that is required with a feature disabled
would otherwise be absent from that build:

```toml
[[feature-profile]]
name = "all"
all-features = true

[[feature-profile]]
name = "minimal"
no-default-features = true

[[feature-profile]]
name = "serde-only"
no-default-features = true
features = ["serde"]
```

Hawk compiles every applicable production target, every workspace
non-production target, and every selected doctest package under each profile.
Only production targets explicitly limited with `feature-profiles` are skipped.
Fragments are stored separately for each profile, then their reachability and
visibility requirements are combined before diagnostics are produced. A
declaration required in any configured profile is therefore preserved.

Profile names must be unique and contain only ASCII letters, digits, `-`, or
`_`. `all-features = true` cannot be combined with `no-default-features` or an
explicit `features` list. A profile with none of those settings uses Cargo's
default features. Each string in `features` is passed as a separate Cargo
`--features` value.

Automatic fixes are currently rejected when multiple feature profiles are
configured. Applying a visibility change safely across several configurations
requires a coordinated fix plan; run the matrix without `--fix`, or select a
single profile for a fixing run. Feature profiles do not select compilation
targets; `--target` still selects one target for the entire analysis.

## Uniform field visibility

Set `preserve-uniform-field-visibility = true` to retain a struct or union's
intentional uniform field visibility:

```toml
preserve-uniform-field-visibility = true
```

When every source-written field has the same visibility, Hawk preserves that
visibility if at least one field requires it. Otherwise, Hawk applies the least
aggressive available reduction to every field. For example, if one
`pub(crate)` field requires `pub(super)` and another can be private, Hawk
suggests `pub(super)` for both when `hawk::unnecessary_crate_visibility` is
enabled. That lint is allow-by-default; without it, Hawk preserves the group's
`pub(crate)` visibility. If every field can be private, Hawk reports that
reduction for the full group. The policy does not suppress `hawk::dead_public`.

Hawk conservatively preserves the current group when a source-written field is
absent from the compiled graph, such as a `#[cfg]`-disabled field, or when a
field opts out of analysis with `#[allow(dead_code)]`. Those fields cannot
participate in a safe group-wide fix.

This setting is disabled by default. It does not apply to mixed-visibility
declarations or declarations whose complete source field list is unavailable,
such as macro-generated structs.

## Overrides

An override records an intentional finding without changing the analysis:

```toml
[[override]]
lint = "hawk::dead_public"
crate = "library"
item = "legacy_entry"
level = "allow"
reason = "retained temporarily while consumers migrate"

[[override]]
lint = "hawk::unnecessary_public"
crate = "library"
item = "generated_registration"
kind = "function"
level = "expect"
reason = "called by generated registration that Hawk does not model"

[[override]]
lint = "hawk::unnecessary_restricted_visibility"
crate = "library"
item = "platform::shared_helper"
level = "expect"
reason = "called by generated platform code that Hawk does not model"

[[override]]
lint = "hawk::dead_public"
crate = "platform"
item = "windows_only_api"
level = "expect"
target = "cfg(windows)"
reason = "public API retained only in the Windows build"
```

`allow` suppresses a matching finding. `expect` suppresses a matching finding
and reports `hawk::unfulfilled_expectation` if that finding is no longer
present. An override whose selectors no longer identify a compiled item
reports `hawk::unknown_item`. If an override without `kind` identifies
multiple same-named declarations, Hawk reports `hawk::ambiguous_item` and
suppresses none of them.

When an audit is limited to selected library targets, overrides for other
compiled workspace crates are ignored. Overrides naming an unknown crate or an
unknown item in an audited crate still report `hawk::unknown_item`.

Definitions from the same Cargo package with the same crate, diagnostic path,
and item kind are one logical override identity even when cfg alternatives
compile them from different source locations. An override applies to every
such physical variant, and an `expect` is fulfilled when at least one variant
produces the selected finding. Workspace library crate names are required to
be unique, so definitions in different packages cannot share an override
identity. Same-path declarations in different Rust namespaces remain
ambiguous unless `kind` is supplied.

The `item` value names Hawk's diagnostic path. For exported aliases, use the
alias name, such as `PublicAlias`; for modules, use the module path, such as
`api::internal`. Add `kind` when separate Rust namespaces define declarations
with the same path. It accepts Hawk's item-kind names, such as `function`,
`type_alias`, and `constant`.

Overrides filter diagnostics only. Unlike a `[[production]]` entry, an
override does not define a production target, establish reachability, or
preserve public visibility for referenced declarations.

## Exclusions

Use an exclusion when an entire module subtree or source file is outside the
diagnostic surface, for example generated code:

```toml
[[exclude]]
crate = "library"
module = "generated_bindings"
level = "expect"
reason = "generated from the protocol schema"

[[exclude]]
crate = "platform"
file = "platform/src/generated.rs"
reason = "generated platform bindings"
```

An exclusion must provide exactly one of `module` or `file`. A module selector
uses Hawk's diagnostic path and suppresses the selected module and all
descendants, such as `generated_bindings::Message`. A file selector matches
the source path printed in diagnostics. Both forms suppress all Hawk findings
in their selected scope.

Exclusions default to `level = "allow"`. Set `level = "expect"` when the
selected scope should currently contain at least one finding. Hawk then reports
`hawk::unfulfilled_expectation` if the exclusion becomes stale because it no
longer suppresses anything.

Exclusions filter diagnostics and fixes only; they do not change reachability
or preserve visibility. Prefer an exact `[[override]]` when an individual
diagnostic is an intentional exception that should remain audited with
`expect`.

## Target selectors

`[[production]]`, `[[override]]`, and `[[exclude]]` accept an optional
`target`. The value uses the same named targets and `cfg(...)` platform
expressions as Cargo target dependencies:

```toml
[[production]]
package = "windows-helper"
bin = "windows-helper"
target = "cfg(windows)"
reason = "Windows-only production binary"

[[override]]
lint = "hawk::dead_public"
crate = "platform"
item = "windows_fallback"
level = "expect"
target = "cfg(not(windows))"
reason = "non-Windows compatibility surface"
```

An entry is validated only when its selector applies to the analyzed
compilation target. This avoids stale-expectation failures for declarations
that are not compiled on that target.

## External library boundaries

`hawk.toml` defines production targets and diagnostic exceptions. To omit an
entire workspace library crate because it exposes a supported API outside the
closed-world analysis, pass `--exclude-crate`:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  --exclude-crate supported_library
```

Excluded crates are compiled as required by Cargo, but Hawk does not report
their public declarations.
