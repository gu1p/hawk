# Using Hawk

Hawk analyzes public declarations in workspace library crates against
configured production targets and workspace non-production targets. This guide
covers invoking the tool; see [Configuration](configuration.md) for the
`hawk.toml` reference and [Architecture](architecture.md) for the analysis
model.

## Install a prebuilt release

Hawk is pinned to Rust 1.98.0 and uses `rustc_private`. A prebuilt release
still requires the exact normal Rust toolchain, but it does not require
`rustc-dev`, `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP`, or a source build:

```sh
rustup toolchain install 1.98.0
```

Install the latest release with the standalone shell installer:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/astral-sh/hawk/releases/latest/download/cargo-hawk-installer.sh | sh
```

The installer places `cargo-hawk` and `cargo-hawk-driver` on your `PATH` in
the same directory. You can instead download the archive for your platform
from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/astral-sh/hawk/releases) and place
both executables on your `PATH` manually.

Run the Cargo subcommand with the pinned toolchain:

```sh
cargo +1.98.0 hawk check --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml
```

## Build Hawk

Hawk is pinned to Rust 1.98.0 and uses `rustc_private`; the repository
toolchain configuration installs `rustc-dev` when necessary. A source build
produces a `cargo-hawk` frontend and a `cargo-hawk-driver` compiler wrapper.

```sh
cargo build
```

## Configure production targets

Without a `hawk.toml`, Hawk treats every workspace binary as a production
target. To select specific binaries or audit internal libraries, declare the
desired production targets in `hawk.toml` at the root of the workspace being
analyzed:

```toml
[[production]]
package = "app"
bin = "app"
reason = "shipped application binary"
```

Every configured package and binary must be a target of that workspace. Once a
configuration file exists, its production targets are authoritative: an API used
only by an omitted binary can be reported as unnecessary or dead. See
[Configuration](configuration.md) for multiple binaries, target-scoped entries,
and accepted findings.

## Run analysis

Run `cargo hawk` without a subcommand to see the available commands. Use
`check` to analyze a workspace:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml
```

Configured production targets and workspace non-production targets are
analyzed under `--all-features --locked` on the host target by default. A
`[[feature-profile]]` matrix in `hawk.toml` can replace that single feature
selection; Hawk unions evidence from every profile before producing
diagnostics. The non-production surface includes tests, benches, examples, and
compile-only doctests, which can be restricted to explicit packages with
`[[doctest]]` entries. Diagnostics apply to workspace library crates compiled
for those targets, including declarations enabled only under `cfg(test)`.

Workspace libraries are treated as internal unless exempted. Exclude a
library crate whose public API is consumed outside the configured production
targets:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  --exclude-crate supported_library
```

Instrumented Cargo artifacts are reused under
`cargo-hawk-target/<workspace-name>-<path-hash>` in the platform temporary
directory by default. Including the workspace path prevents same-named
checkouts and worktrees from sharing Cargo locks and artifacts. Use
`--target-dir` to override that location and `--graph-dir` to retain serialized
compiler fragments for investigation. Diagnostics are colored automatically
in a terminal; use `--color=always` or `--color=never` to override terminal
detection.

Use `--output-format=json` for a machine-readable diagnostic report. For a
completed analysis, Cargo progress and compiler output remain on stderr, so
stdout contains exactly one JSON object. Operational failures are reported on
stderr and do not produce a JSON report:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  --output-format=json > hawk-report.json
```

The JSON report is versioned with `schema_version` (currently `5`); breaking
schema changes increment this version. Its `summary` describes the compilation
target, configured production binaries or libraries, feature profiles,
non-production coverage, and emitted diagnostic count.
Every entry in `diagnostics` includes its category, lint code, and severity.
Finding entries additionally include their finding kind, semantic identity
(`package`, `crate`, `item`, definition `kind`, parent, and module scope),
target-independent source-qualified identity (`identity.id`), compiler identity
(`identity.compiler_id`), available source and expansion locations,
and the `test_only` and `test_compiled_only` flags. Source locations include
`line`, `column`, `end_line`, `end_column`, `byte_start`, and `byte_end` when a
complete declaration range is available. Lines and columns are one-based,
columns count Unicode scalar values, and byte offsets are zero-based UTF-8
offsets into the original source file. `end_line`/`end_column` and `byte_end`
are exclusive; ranges include source-spanned attributes, documentation, and
trailing field, variant, or re-export separators.
The stable identity uses versioned, length-prefixed package, crate, item,
definition kind, and source-location components, so cfg and path alternatives
remain distinct while the same declaration can be correlated across targets;
the compiler identity can change with the target or feature set.
When rustc cannot retain a complete range for a parsed attribute, such as
`#[cold]` or `#[unsafe(link_section = "...")]`, the location intentionally
falls back to `file`, `line`, and `column`; ending locations and byte offsets
are omitted.
Configuration diagnostics identify either the referenced lint and item or the
excluded scope, along with the configuration location and reason.

`--fix` supports the default profile or one explicitly configured feature
profile. Hawk rejects fixing runs with a multi-profile matrix; run analysis
without `--fix` to review the combined findings.

## Enforce diagnostics

Hawk reports diagnostics as warnings by default, so it can be introduced
without changing build status. Deny the `warnings` group to use Hawk as a CI
gate:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  -D warnings
```

Hawk accepts Clippy-style ordered `-A`/`--allow`, `-W`/`--warn`, and
`-D`/`--deny` lint levels. Later options take precedence:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  -D warnings \
  -W hawk::unnecessary_public
```

The supported selectors are `warnings`, `hawk::dead_public`,
`hawk::unnecessary_public`, `hawk::unnecessary_restricted_visibility`,
`hawk::unnecessary_crate_visibility`, `hawk::test_only`, `hawk::unknown_item`,
`hawk::ambiguous_item`, and `hawk::unfulfilled_expectation`. Denied diagnostics
are emitted as errors and cause a non-zero exit status. Invalid configuration
and failed instrumented Cargo builds fail independently of lint levels.

To focus on deletion candidates in either text or JSON output, pass
`--only dead-public`. This suppresses visibility-reduction findings while
preserving configuration diagnostics such as unknown items and unfulfilled
expectations:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  --only dead-public
```

In text output, the final summary groups emitted findings by lint and Cargo
package. Hawk reports configuration diagnostics separately under
`configuration`.

`hawk::unnecessary_crate_visibility` is allow-by-default because preferring
`pub(super)` over `pub(crate)` is a style choice. Enable it explicitly with
`-W hawk::unnecessary_crate_visibility` or
`-D hawk::unnecessary_crate_visibility`. The `warnings` group does not enable
allow-by-default lints.

`hawk::test_only` is also allow-by-default. It reports source declarations
compiled in production but reachable exclusively from non-production roots:
tests, benches, examples, or doctests. Unlike visibility diagnostics, it is
reported even when a cross-crate integration test requires the declaration to
remain public. Declarations compiled only under `cfg(test)` are not included.
Use it as a focused deletion-candidate gate with:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  --only test-only \
  -D hawk::test_only
```

The lint covers source-written functions, inherent methods and associated
constants, traits, structs, enums, unions, type aliases, constants, statics,
fields, enum variants, explicitly visible named re-exports, and modules. It is
report-only; removing a declaration and its non-production consumers requires
a coordinated source edit.

## Apply fixes

Pass `--fix` to apply visibility reductions through Cargo's fix machinery:

```sh
./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  --fix
```

Hawk emits machine-applicable suggestions for enabled, unsuppressed
visibility findings. `hawk::unnecessary_public` reduces `pub` to `pub(crate)`.
`hawk::unnecessary_restricted_visibility` removes an explicit restricted
visibility modifier when the item can be private.
`hawk::unnecessary_crate_visibility` optionally reduces `pub(crate)` to
`pub(super)`. `hawk::dead_public` remains report-only because a visibility-only
edit can activate rustc's `dead_code` lint; removing dead surface may require
editing its remaining internal uses. `hawk::test_only` is report-only because
removing a declaration requires removing its non-production consumers as well.
Hawk delegates edit application and validation to `cargo fix`, including
Cargo's source-control safety checks; pass `--allow-dirty`, `--allow-staged`,
or `--allow-no-vcs` with `--fix` when the corresponding Cargo override is
appropriate.

Fixes are limited to workspace library packages in the configured production
or non-production surface. Hawk rechecks configured production targets and
non-production targets, including compile-only doctests, after applying
edits. Dead declarations and enum variants remain report-only.

## Analyze another target

Pass `--target TRIPLE` to analyze another compilation target. Hawk forwards
the target to Cargo but does not install a target SDK or configure a cross
linker. When `--target` is omitted, Hawk explicitly analyzes the host target;
this overrides Cargo's `build.target` configuration and `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`
so compilation, target-scoped configuration, and reported coverage agree.

For example, a macOS host can analyze Windows MSVC production targets using
[`cargo-xwin`](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-xwin). From the Hawk
checkout, prepare the pinned toolchain once:

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-xwin --locked
```

Then export the linker and Windows SDK configuration for Hawk's child Cargo
process before running the analysis:

```sh
target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
eval "$(cargo xwin env --quiet \
  --target "$target" \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml)"

./target/debug/cargo-hawk check \
  --manifest-path /path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml \
  --target "$target"
```

Target-scoped production entries and expectations can keep platform-specific
surfaces explicit; see [Configuration](configuration.md).
